## IgH EtherCAT Master Installation Guide 
**Note:** This guide is basically [the one by Thomas Bitsky](http://lists.etherlab.org/pipermail/etherlab-users/2015/002820.html), with slight modifications.  
___
**Note:** The installation sequence is   
1. kernel-RTAI    
2. RTAI   
3. IgH EtherCAT Master 

or, alternatively

1. kernel-PREEMPT_RT
2. IgH EtherCAT Master 

This guide describes the last step in the process.
___
### 1. Download the library
Download the snapshot of `stable-1.5` branch from [here](https://sourceforge.net/p/etherlabmaster/code/ci/stable-1.5/tree/). I got the snapshot at commit 336936.
Here I'm assuming you have extracted it in the home directory, and named it `stable-1.5`.
```bash
sudo -s
```
Move into the source directory,
```bash
cd ~/stable-1.5
```
In the source on SourceForge, for some reason rtdm-ioctl.c is basically empty (the only line is `ioctl.c`). To avoid running into errors when building the library,
```bash
cp ~/stable-1.5/master/ioctl.c ~/stable-1.5/master/rtdm-ioctl.c
```
### 2. Install the library
Install a few build tools
```bash
apt-get install autoconf libtool
```
Make `bootstrap` file executable and generate the configure file.
```bash
chmod +x bootstrap
```
```bash
./bootstrap
```
Make `configure` file executable.
```bash
chmod +x configure
```
Configure the Makefile.
___
**Note:** We're going to use the modified Realtek8169 driver. Hence, the "--enable-r8169" option.   
___
**Note:** If you're not going to write LXRT programs (RTAI in user space) ignore "--enable-rtdm".  
___
**Note:** Be sure to apply the last option if have installed RTAI in `/usr/realtime`. If it's installed in a different directory, adjust the specified path accordingly. If you don't intend to compile RTAI codes at all, ignore this option.   
___
**Note:** See IgH EtherCAT Master 1.5.2 documentation for other options.
___
```bash
./configure --enable-generic --disable-8139too --enable-r8169 --enable-cycles --enable-rtdm --with-rtai-dir=/usr/realtime
```
Compile and install the modules,  
```bash
make
```
```bash
make modules
```
```bash
make install
```
```bash
make modules_install
```
```bash
depmod
```
### 3. Configure the master
There are some parameters associated with the master module (e.g. NIC MAC address, driver to use). We specify these in a file `/etc/sysconfig`. 
```bash
sudo mkdir /etc/sysconfig/
```
```bash
sudo cp /opt/etherlab/etc/sysconfig/ethercat /etc/sysconfig/
```
```bash
sudo nano /etc/sysconfig/ethercat
```
Run `ifconfig` (in another terminal) and copy the MAC address of `eth0`. Paste it between the quotes in front of `MASTER0_DEVICE`.  
```bash
MASTER0_DEVICE="00:05:9a:3c:7a:00"
```
The field in front of `DEVICE_MODULES` is the name of the driver which the master modules will use. Since we compiled with `--enable-r8169`, we will use the modified r8169 driver for the best performance. 
```bash
DEVICE_MODULES=“r8169"
```
Press ctrl+x to save and exit.
__
**Note:** If your network card isn't supported by EtherLab, or EtherLab doesn't support your kernel version, `DEVICE_MODULES=“generic"`.  
___
Copy the initilization script,
```bash
cd /opt/etherlab
```
```bash
cp ./etc/init.d/ethercat /etc/init.d/
```
Give execution permission (for starting and stopping the ethercat master module) to all groups,
```bash
sudo chmod a+x /etc/init.d/ethercat
```
Make the ethercat command line tools (for example, `$ethercat slaves`) available,
```bash
sudo ln -s /opt/etherlab/bin/ethercat /usr/local/bin/ethercat
```
The ethercat command line tool communicates with the master module as a character device, and we're going to give "normal" (non-root) users access to this device (thus enabling users to use command line tools).
Create `99-EtherCAT.rules`,
```bash
nano /etc/udev/rules.d/99-EtherCAT.rules
```
And add the following line to it,
```bash
KERNEL=="EtherCAT[0-9]*", MODE="0664"
```
Press ctrl+x to save and exit.
At this point, you should be able to start the master,
```bash
sudo /etc/init.d/ethercat start
```
### Extra notes
**Note:** To view the kernel log, either open `/var/log/syslog` with a text editor or
```bash
tail -f -n 10 /var/log/syslog
```
To view the 10 latest kernel messages (printed with `printk`). Additionally,
```bash
dmesg
```
also outputs the last kernel messages.
___
**Note:** In case you needed to reinstall the package, `make mrproper` in `~/stable-1.5` and delete `etherlab` in `/opt`. Then follow the installation guide up to (and including) the `depmod` step. (Obviously, to install another version, `make mrproper` in the current version's folder is not necessary.)
___
**Note:** To enable debug messages (in kernel log),
```bash
ethercat debug 1
```
